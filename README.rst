    :alt: Documentation Status

A Python interface to the number theory library `PARI/GP <http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/>`_.

Installation
------------

From a distribution package (GNU/Linux, conda-forge)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A package might be available in your package manager, see
https://repology.org/project/python:cypari2/versions

From source with pip
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Requirements:

- PARI/GP >= 2.9.4 (header files and library); see
  https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/spkg/pari#spkg-pari
  for availability in distributions (GNU/Linux, conda-forge, Homebrew, FreeBSD),
  or install from source.
- Python >= 3.6
- pip

Install cypari2 via the Python Package Index (PyPI) via

::

    $ pip install cypari2 [--user]

(the optional option *--user* allows to install cypari2 for a single user
and avoids using pip with administrator rights).

`pip` builds the package using build isolation.  All Python build dependencies
of the package, declared in pyproject.toml, are automatically installed in
a temporary virtual environment.

If you want to try the development version, use

::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/sagemath/cypari2.git [--user]

If you have an error saying libpari-gmp*.so* is missing and have all requirements
already installed, try to reinstall cysignals and cypari2

::

    $ pip install cysignals --upgrade [--user]
    $ pip install cypari2 --upgrade [--user]

Usage
-----

The interface as been kept as close as possible from PARI/GP. The following
computation in GP

::

    ? zeta(2)
    %1 = 1.6449340668482264364724151666460251892

    ? p = x^3 + x^2 + x - 1;
    ? modulus = t^3 + t^2 + t - 1;
    ? fq = factorff(p, 3, modulus);
    ? centerlift(lift(fq))
    %5 =
    [            x - t 1]

    [x + (t^2 + t - 1) 1]

    [   x + (-t^2 - 1) 1]

translates into

::

    >>> import cypari2
    >>> pari = cypari2.Pari()

    >>> pari(2).zeta()
    1.64493406684823

    >>> p = pari("x^3 + x^2 + x - 1")
    >>> modulus = pari("t^3 + t^2 + t - 1")
    >>> fq = p.factorff(3, modulus)
    >>> fq.lift().centerlift()
    [x - t, 1; x + (t^2 + t - 1), 1; x + (-t^2 - 1), 1]

The object **pari** above is the object for the interface and acts as a
constructor. It can be called with basic Python objects like integer
or floating point. When called with a string as in the last example
the corresponding string is interpreted as if it was executed in a GP shell.

Beyond the interface object **pari** of type **Pari**, any object you get a
handle on is of type **Gen** (that is a wrapper around the **GEN** type from
libpari). All PARI/GP functions are then available in their original names as
*methods* like **zeta**, **factorff**, **lift** or **centerlift** above.

Alternatively, the pari functions are accessible as methods of **pari**. The
same computations be done via

::

    >>> import cypari2
    >>> pari = cypari2.Pari()

    >>> pari.zeta(2)
    1.64493406684823

    >>> p = pari("x^3 + x^2 + x - 1")
    >>> modulus = pari("t^3 + t^2 + t - 1")
    >>> fq = pari.factorff(p, 3, modulus)
    >>> pari.centerlift(pari.lift(fq))
    [x - t, 1; x + (t^2 + t - 1), 1; x + (-t^2 - 1), 1]
